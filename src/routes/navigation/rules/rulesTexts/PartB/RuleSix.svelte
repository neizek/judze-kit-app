<p>Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:</p>
<p>(a) By all vessels:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(i)	the state of visibility;</li>
	<li>(ii) the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;</li>
	<li>(iii) the manoeuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;</li>
	<li>(iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;</li>
	<li>(v)	the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;</li>
	<li>(vi) the draught in relation to the available depth of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;</li>
	<li>(ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;</li>
	<li>(iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference;</li>
	<li>(iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;</li>
	<li>(v)	the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar;</li>
	<li>(vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.</li>
</ul>
